:books: About the Glossary of Terms
---

The AIM Research Support Facility (RSF), based at The Alan Turing Institute with collaborators from Swansea University and the University of Edinburgh, offers AI and advanced data science support to the research teams part of the [NIHR's Artificial Intelligence for Multiple Long-Term Conditions (AIM)](https://www.nihr.ac.uk/blog/artificial-intelligence-to-understand-clusters-of-multiple-long-term-conditions-an-nihr-priority/25171) project.

Our community has compiled a [Glossary](./glossary) of common terms relating to Health, Medicine, Artificial Intelligence, and Data Science to support the development and dissemnation of AIM project work. The Glossary can be accessed by visiting the public website which has been built with JupytherBook and deployed using GitHub Pages. </br>

You can visit the website at this link: https://aim-rsf.github.io/Glossary-of-Terms.   

This repository and its contents are here to help folks collaborate on the Glossary of Terms. We know that the field of AI and Medicine is huge (and continually expanding) so we hope that this is an area that will be consistently updated as the AIM project grows. The Glossary's contents are being developed ****openly**** and we invites contributions from ****anyone**** who wants to support the work of the AI for Multiple Long-Term Conditions Project.
