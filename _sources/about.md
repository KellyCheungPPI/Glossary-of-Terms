# About the AIM RSF

Many people are living with multiple health conditions, yet surprisingly little is known about identifying and treating multiple long-term conditions (MTLC). To address this, the National Institute of Health and Care Research directed £23 million towards a AI for Multiple Long-term Conditions (AIM) Programme to establish research to better understand and treat MLTCs.

Hosted by The Alan Turing Institute in collaboration with the Swansea University and the University of Edinburgh, a dedicated Research Support Facility (RSF) has been established to facilitate research collaborations and offer AI and advanced data science expertise to the teams across the independently-funded AIM research consortia.

The AIM RSF’s overarching ambition is to support and advocate for open, inclusive, and collaborative practice that delivers research ‘greater than the sum of its parts’, in order to maximise both the scientific impact and potential for patient benefit of research outputs.
