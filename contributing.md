This repository is here to help folks get started collaborating on the AIM-RSF glossary of terms. We know that the field of AI and Medicine is huge (and continually expanding) so we hope that this is an area that will be consistently updated as the AIM project grows. The Glossary's contents are being developed ****openly**** and we invites contributions from ****anyone**** who wants to support the work of the AI for Multiple Long-Term Conditions Project.

A primary goal of our AI for Multiple Long Term Conditions Community is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion. This document outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior. We invite all those who participate in the AIM RSF Community to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.
