### About the Glossary of Terms

The AIM Research Support Facility (RSF), based at The Alan Turing Institute with collaborators from Swansea University and the University of Edinburgh, offers AI and advanced data science support to the research teams part of the [NIHR's Artificial Intelligence for Multiple Long-Term Conditions (AIM)](https://www.nihr.ac.uk/blog/artificial-intelligence-to-understand-clusters-of-multiple-long-term-conditions-an-nihr-priority/25171) project.

Our community has compiled a Glossary of common terms relating to Health and Medical Research, Artificial Intelligence, Public and Patient Involvement, and Data Science to support the development and dissemnation of AIM project work.
