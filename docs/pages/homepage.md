### About the Glossary of Terms

The AIM Research Support Facility (RSF), based at The Alan Turing Institute with collaborators from Swansea University and the University of Edinburgh, offers AI and advanced data science support to the research teams part of the [NIHR's Artificial Intelligence for Multiple Long-Term Conditions (AIM)](https://www.nihr.ac.uk/blog/artificial-intelligence-to-understand-clusters-of-multiple-long-term-conditions-an-nihr-priority/25171) project.

Our community has compiled a Glossary of common terms relating to Health and Medical Research, Artificial Intelligence, Public and Patient Involvement, and Data Science to support the development and dissemnation of AIM project work.

You can find a [full list of terms](https://aim-rsf.github.io/Glossary-of-Terms/genindex.html), or browse the topic pages to find topic specific terms. 

### How to use the Glossary 

The Glossary has been developed to help make engagement in meetings, seminars, and AIM research easier. Our community wants to help foster conversations between experts by study and experts by experience, and a large part of that means understanding one another. 

We hope that you can use (and improve) the Glossary as you engage in, read about, and tell others about the awesome research happening as part of AIM. This Glossary may start of as just a list of words and definitions, but ultimately we hope it leads to better, more accessible, and more accurate research that helps everyone worldwide.
