# Artificial Intelligence and Data Science

This section of the Glossary contains terms relating to Artificial Intelligence and Data Science.

```{glossary}
Algorithm
  A set of rules that a machine (such as a computer) can follow to learn how to do a task {cite}`denny2020`.

Artificial Intelligence
  An artificially intelligent computer system makes predictions or takes actions based on patterns in existing data for example notifying a GP when disease risk factors have been identified in a patients records.

Autonomous
  A machine is described as autonomous if it can perform its task or tasks without needing human intervention {cite}`telus2021`.

Data mining	
  The process of analysing datasets in order to discover new patterns that might improve the model.

Data science	
  Drawing from statistics, computer science and information science, this interdisciplinary field aims to use a variety of scientific methods, processes and systems to solve problems involving data.

Dataset	
  A collection of related data points, usually with a uniform order and tags.
  
Label	
	A part of training data that identifies the desired output for that particular piece of data.

Machine Intelligence	
	An umbrella term for various types of learning algorithms, including machine learning and deep learning.

Machine Learning	
	This subset of AI is particularly focused on developing algorithms that will help machines to learn and change in response to new data, without the help of a human being.

Model	
	A broad term referring to the product of AI training, created by running a machine learning algorithm on training data.

Natural Language Generation (NLG)
	This refers to the process by which a machine turns structured data into text or speech that humans can understand. Essentially, NLG is concerned with what a machine writes or says as the end part of the communication process.

Natural Language Processing (NLP)
	The umbrella term for any machine’s ability to perform conversational tasks, such as recognizing what is said to it, understanding the intended meaning and responding intelligibly.

Natural Language Understanding (NLU)
	As a subset of natural language processing, natural language understanding deals with helping machines to recognize the intended meaning of language — taking into account its subtle nuances and any grammatical errors.

Python	
  A popular programming language used for general programming. {cite}`perez2011python`
