# Glossary

* Algorithm
    * A set of rules that a machine can follow to learn how to do a task.
        * Citation: 
* Artificial Intelligence
    * An artificially intelligent computer system makes predictions or takes actions based on patterns in existing data for example notifying a GP when disease risk factors have been identified in a patients records.
        * Citation: 

* ATC: Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical code. 
    * ATC is a unique code assigned to a medicine according to the organ or system it works on and how it works. The classification system is maintained by the World Health Organization (WHO)
        * Citation:
* Autonomous 
    * A machine is described as autonomous if it can perform its task or tasks without needing human intervention. 
        * Citation
* Data Mining 
    * The process of analysing datasets in order to discover new patterns that might improve the model.
        * Citation:
* Data Science
    * Drawing from statistics, computer science and information science, this interdisciplinary field aims to use a variety of scientific methods, processes and systems to solve problems involving data. 
        * Citation: 
* Dataset
    * A collection of related data points, usually with a uniform order and tags.
        * Citation: 
* Epidemiology 
    * The study of how often diseases occur in different groups of people and why. Epidemiological information is used to plan and evaluate strategies to prevent illness and as a guide to the management of patients in whom disease has already developed.
        * Citation: 
* Label	
    * A part of training data that identifies the desired output for that particular piece of data.
        * Citation: 
* Machine Intelligence 
    * An umbrella term for various types of learning algorithms, including machine learning and deep learning.
        * Citation:
* Machine Learning 
    * This subset of AI is particularly focused on developing algorithms that will help machines to learn and change in response to new data, without the help of a human being.
        * Citation:
* Model	
    * A broad term referring to the product of AI training, created by running a machine learning algorithm on training data.
        * Citation: 
* Natural Language Generation (NLG)
    * This refers to the process by which a machine turns structured data into text or speech that humans can understand. Essentially, NLG is concerned with what a machine writes or says as the end part of the communication process. 
        * Citation:  
* Natural Language Processing (NLP)
    * The umbrella term for any machine’s ability to perform conversational tasks, such as recognizing what is said to it, understanding the intended meaning and responding intelligibly. 
        * Citation: 
* Natural Language Understanding (NLU) 
    * As a subset of natural language processing, natural language understanding deals with helping machines to recognize the intended meaning of language — taking into account its subtle nuances and any grammatical errors. 
        * Citation:
* Python
    * A popular programming language used for general programming. 
        * Citation: 
* Population Data Science
    * A multi-disciplinary field, which focuses on collections of individuals, and the biological, economic, social, and environmental experiences that shape their lives, their health and their wellbeing.
        * Citation:
